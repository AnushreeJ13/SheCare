      <h2>What’s a diaphragm?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A diaphragm is a form of birth control that’s a shallow cup shaped like a little saucer that's made of soft silicone. You bend it in half and insert it inside your vagina to cover your cervix. <br><br>
        A diaphragm helps you prevent pregnancy. It works as a barrier that covers your cervix, stopping sperm from joining an egg. In order for a diaphragm to work best, it must be used with spermicide (a cream or gel that kills sperm).<br><br>

      <h2>How effective are diaphragms?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Here’s the deal on diaphragm effectiveness: If you use your diaphragm perfectly every single time you have sex, it’s 94% effective. But nobody’s perfect, so in real life diaphragms are about 83% effective — that means about 13 out of 100 people who use a diaphragm will get pregnant each year. That's because people don't always follow the directions correctly, or they don't use their diaphragm every single time they have sex.</p>
