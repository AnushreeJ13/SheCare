      <h2>What is the birth control pill?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Birth control pills are a kind of medicine with hormones. Birth control pills come in a pack, and you take 1 pill every day. The pill is safe, affordable, and effective if you always take your pill on time. Besides preventing pregnancy, the pill has lots of other health benefits, too.<br><br>

       <b>There are two kinds of birth control pills:</b><br><br>
        
        Combination pills (aka combined oral contraceptives, or COCs)<br><br>
        
        Combination pills have both estrogen and progestin<br><br>
        
        These are the most common type of birth control pill <br><br>
        
        Progestin-only pills (aka POPs or mini pills)<br><br>
        
        Progestin-only pills only have progestin<br><br></p>

      <h2>How effective is the birth control pill?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you use it perfectly, the pill is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect and it’s easy to forget or miss pills — so in reality the pill is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 pill users get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        The better you are about taking your pill every day and starting your pill packs on time, the better the pill will work. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always take your pills correctly.<br><br></p>

      <h2>What birth control side effects should I expect while taking the pill?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The hormones in birth control pills may cause side effects in some people. But this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the pill with no problems. <br><br>

        <b>After starting the pill, some people may have:</b> <br><br>
        
        1.Headaches <br><br>
        
       2. Nausea<br><br>
        
       3. Sore breasts<br><br>
        
       4. Changes in your periods (early, late, or stopping altogether while on the pill)<br><br>
        
        5.Spotting (bleeding between periods or brown discharge)<br><br>
        
        The good news is that these side effects usually go away in 2-3 months. So if you just started the pill and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. <br><br>
        
        Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. If you still don’t like the way the pill makes you feel after a few months, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may suggest another brand of pill or a different birth control method. Some people try a few different types of pills or birth control methods before finding the right one for them. <br><br>
        
        And remember: if you stop taking the pill and don’t use another birth control method, you’ll be at risk for pregnancy right away.<br><br>
        
        The birth control pill has been around for decades, and millions of people have used it safely. Birth control pill side effects aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks with taking the pill, like with any medicine).<br><br></p>
