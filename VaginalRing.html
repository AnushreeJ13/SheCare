    <div class="content">
      <p>The birth control ring (AKA the vaginal ring, or the ring) is a safe and convenient birth control method that works really well if you always use it correctly. You wear a small, flexible ring inside your vagina, and it prevents pregnancy 24/7 by releasing hormones into your body. The ring has lots of other health benefits, too. There are 2 kinds of birth control rings: NuvaRing and Annovera.</p>

      <h2>How effective is the birth control ring?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you use it perfectly, the ring is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect and it can be easy to make a mistake — so in reality the ring is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 ring users get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        The better you are about putting the ring in your vagina on schedule, the better it will work. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always use the ring correctly.</p><br><br>

      <h2>Who can’t use birth control rings?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Like all medicines, the ring isn’t for everyone.<br><br>

        Smoking and birth control rings don’t always mix<br><br> 
        
        1.If you smoke 15 cigarettes a day or more, don’t use NuvaRing, Annovera, or any other kind of birth control that has the hormone estrogen. <br><br>
        2.If you smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day or vape nicotine at all, talk with your nurse or doctor about whether the birth control ring is safe for you. <br><br>
        Smoking while taking birth control with estrogen (like combination pills, the patch, or the ring), makes you more likely to have problems like a stroke or heart attack.<br><br>
        
        If you’re a regular smoker, you can safely use any other method without estrogen — like progestin-only pills, the birth control shot, the birth control implant, and IUDs.<br><br>
        
        <b>Also avoid using the ring if you’ve had any of these health problems:</b><br><br>
        
       1. blood clots, an inherited blood-clotting disorder, or vein inflammation<br><br>
        
        2.breast cancer<br><br>
        
        3.heart attack, stroke, angina, or other serious heart problems<br><br>
        
        4.migraine headaches with aura (seeing flashing, zigzag lines)<br><br>
        
       5. uncontrolled high blood pressure<br><br>
        
        6.very bad diabetes or liver disease<br><br>
        
        Talk with your doctor or nurse about your health history.  They can help you decide if the ring is right for you.<br><br>
        
        NuvaRing and Annovera rings are latex-free, so they’re safe for people with latex allergies.<br><br></p>
