    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">How soon after giving birth can I start using contraception?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>It's generally safe to start using contraception immediately after giving birth, although the recommended method may vary depending on individual circumstances.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Are contraceptive methods reversible?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Most contraceptive methods are reversible, meaning fertility returns to normal after discontinuation. For example, hormonal methods like birth control pills and implants can be stopped, and fertility typically resumes within a few menstrual cycles. However, some methods like sterilization may be permanent. It's important to discuss the reversibility of each method with your healthcare provider.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="question">Do contraceptive methods protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>No, most contraceptive methods do not provide protection against STIs. Only barrier methods like condoms offer dual protection against both pregnancy and STIs by creating a physical barrier between partners. It's essential to use condoms consistently and correctly to reduce the risk of STI transmission.</p>
