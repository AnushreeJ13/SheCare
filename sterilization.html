      <p>Want to make sure pregnancy is not in your future? Sterilization (sometimes called female sterilization, tubal ligation, or “getting your tubes tied”) is a safe and effective surgical procedure that permanently prevents pregnancy.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>There are a few different types of tubal sterilization procedures:</b><br><br>

       1. Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that permanently closes, cuts, or removes pieces of your fallopian tubes.<br><br>
        
       2. Bilateral salpingectomy is a surgical procedure that removes your fallopian tubes entirely.<br><br>
        
       3. Essure sterilization is a tiny coil that a doctor puts in your fallopian tubes to block them — it used to be a common form of sterilization, but Essure is no longer available in the U.S.<br><br>

      <h2>How effective is tubal ligation?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Tubal ligation is really great at preventing pregnancy — more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than 1 out of 100 people who have a tubal ligation (get sterilized) will get pregnant each year. That’s as good as it gets when it comes to pregnancy prevention.<br><br>

        The reason why tubal ligation and other types of sterilization work so well is that it protects you from pregnancy around the clock for the rest of your life. So once you have the procedure and your doctor says it’s safe for you to have sex without any other birth control, that’s pretty much it — you don’t have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy. Sterilization is get-it-and-forget-it birth control.<br><br>
