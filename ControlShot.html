      <h2>What is the birth control shot?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The depo shot (AKA Depo-Provera) is an injection you get once every 3 months. It’s a safe, convenient, and private birth control method that works really well if you always get it on time.<br><br>
        The birth control shot (sometimes called Depo-Provera, the Depo shot, or DMPA) contains the hormone progestin.  Progestin stops you from getting pregnant by preventing ovulation.  When there’s no egg in the tube, pregnancy can’t happen. It also works by making cervical mucus thicker. When the mucus on the cervix is thicker, the sperm can’t get through. And when the sperm and the egg can’t get together, pregnancy can’t happen.

      <h2>How effective is the birth control shot?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>When used perfectly, the birth control shot effectiveness is more than 99%, meaning less than 1 out of every 100 people who use it will get pregnant each year. But when it comes to real life, the shot is about 96% effective, because sometimes people forget to get their shots on time. So, in reality, about 4 out of every 100 shot users will get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        The better you are about getting your shot on time, the better it will work. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always get the shot on time.<br><br>
        
        If effectiveness is the most important thing to you when picking what birth control to use, you might want to check out IUDs and the implant. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control. But if you decide the shot is right for you, make sure you always get your follow-up shots on time.<br><br>

      <h2>What birth control shot side effects should I expect?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The hormones in the birth control shot may cause side effects in some people, but this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the shot with no problems at all. <br><br>

        <b>The most common depo shot side effects are changes in your periods, especially during the first year. These include: </b><br><br>
        
        1.Bleeding more days than usual<br><br>
        
        2.Spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge between periods)<br><br>
        
       3. Not getting your period at all<br><br>
        
        About half of people stop getting their period while they’re on the shot (don’t worry, this is totally safe).<br><br>
        
        Other possible side effects include:<br><br>
        
        1.Nausea<br><br>
        
        2.Weight gain<br><br>
        
        3.Headaches<br><br>
        
       4.Sore breasts<br><br>
        
        5.Depression<br><br>
        
        6.Slight bruising where you got the shot<br><br>
        
        7.A small, permanent dent in the skin where you got the shot (this is very rare)<br><br>
        
        Negative Depo shot effects usually go away after 2-3 months, once your body gets used to the hormones in the shot. <br><br>
