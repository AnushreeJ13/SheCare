      <h2>What is a cervical cap?
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A cervical cap is a little cup made from soft silicone and shaped like a sailor's hat. You put it deep inside your vagina to cover your cervix.<br><br>
        The cervical cap covers your cervix, stopping sperm from joining an egg. In order for a cervical cap to work best, it must be used with spermicide (a cream or gel that kills sperm).

      <h2>What’s the difference between cervical caps and diaphragms?
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Cervical caps are smaller than diaphragms and the shape is a little different: diaphragms are shaped like a dish, and cervical caps look like a sailor’s hat. They both work with spermicide and cover your cervix to prevent pregnancy.<br><br>

        You can leave the cervical cap in longer than a diaphragm (up to 2 days), but diaphragms are slightly more effective at preventing pregnancy. Your nurse or doctor can help you decide which one is better for you.<br><br>

      <h2>How effective are cervical caps?
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The cervical cap is a lot more effective if you've never given birth.<br><br>

        For people who’ve never given birth, the cervical cap is 86% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 14 of them will get pregnant within a year.<br><br>
        
        For people who have given birth, the cervical cap is 71% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 29 of them will get pregnant within a year.<br><br>
        
        Like all birth control methods, the cervical cap is most effective when you use it correctly every time you have sex. If you don’t always follow the directions or use your cervical cap every single time you have sex, it won’t work as well.<br><br>
