      <h2>What is a vasectomy?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A vasectomy is a simple surgery done by a doctor in an office, hospital, or clinic. The small tubes in your scrotum that carry sperm are cut or blocked off, so sperm can’t leave your body and cause pregnancy. The procedure is very quick, and you can go home the same day. And it’s extremely effective at preventing pregnancy — almost 100%.<br><br>

        There are two types of vasectomies: the incision method, and the no-scalpel (no-cut) method. No-cut methods lower the risk of infection and other complications, and generally take less time to heal.<br><br>
        
        Vasectomies are meant to be permanent. You should only get a vasectomy if you’re 100% positive you don’t want to be able to get someone pregnant for the rest of your life.<br><br>
        
        The term “vasectomy” comes from the name of the tubes in your scrotum that are blocked during the procedure: vas deferens.<br><br>

      <h2>Can a vasectomy be reversed?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Vasectomies are meant to be permanent, so they can’t always be undone.<br><br>

        It’s sometimes possible to reverse a vasectomy, but there are no guarantees — your fertility may not come back. Vasectomy reversal is a complicated surgery, and it can be very expensive.<br><br>
        
        <b>Whether or not a vasectomy reversal might work depends on:</b><br><br>
        
        1.How long ago you got the vasectomy.<br><br>
        
        2.The type of vasectomy you got.<br><br>
        
        3.The type of reversal procedure you get and the skill of the doctor.<br><br>
        
        If you’re worried about reversal when thinking about getting a vasectomy, it’s probably best to hold off.<br><br>
        
        Before you get a vasectomy, think about any possible life changes that could affect you in the future, like a divorce, a new partner, or the death of a child. You don't need your partner's permission to have a vasectomy — but it may be helpful to talk about it with your partner (or anyone else who could offer support and advice).<br><br>

      <h2>Is a vasectomy effective?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A vasectomy is one of the most effective kinds of birth control out there, and THE most effective method for people with penises and testicles. Vasectomies are almost 100% effective at preventing pregnancy — but not right away. It takes at least 2 months for your semen to become sperm-free.<br><br>

        8-16 weeks after your vasectomy, your doctor will do a simple test called a semen analysis to check for sperm in your semen. Make sure that you ejaculate (cum) at least 20 times before you have your semen tested. For the test, you’ll masturbate into a cup or use a special condom when you have sex to collect a semen sample. Your doctor will tell you when there’s no sperm in your semen and the vasectomy is working as birth control. Don’t have unprotected sex until your doctor says it’s safe.<br><br>
        
        A vasectomy is really effective because it’s designed to be permanent, and you can’t forget to use it or mess it up. It prevents pregnancy round the clock for the rest of your life. So once your doctor says there’s no longer sperm in your semen, that’s pretty much it — you don’t have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy. Vasectomies are get-it-and-forget-it birth control.<br><br>
        
        There’s a very slight chance that the cut ends of your vas deferens can grow back together after a vasectomy, which means you could cause a pregnancy. But this is super rare.<br><br>

      <h2>What are the disadvantages of getting a vasectomy?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A vasectomy is designed to be permanent, so you can’t change your mind later. And like all medical procedures, vasectomies have some risks.
        1.Vasectomies are permanent.
        2.The most common risk with a vasectomy is infection, but those are usually minor and treatable with antibiotics.
        3.Vasectomies don’t prevent STDs.
